    <h1>Computer network types </h1>
    <p><b>LAN </b>(local area network): A LAN connects computers over a relatively short distance, allowing them to share data, files, and resources. For example, a LAN may connect all the computers in an office building, school, or hospital. Typically, LANs are privately owned and managed</p>
    <p><b>WLAN</b> (wireless local area network): A WLAN is just like a LAN but connections between devices on the network are made wirelessly</p>
    <p><b>WAN</b> (wide area network): As the name implies, a WAN connects computers over a wide area, such as from region to region or even continent to continent. The internet is the largest WAN, connecting billions of computers worldwide. You will typically see collective or distributed ownership models for WAN management</p>
